**This work presents an alternative and more efficient method for counting vehicles in videos using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques.**

> Conducted at the [University of São Paulo - USP](https://www5.usp.br/) under the guidance of [Prof. Nina S. T. Hirata](https://www.ime.usp.br/nina/).

We developed a system that combines YOLO, for vehicle detection, with Visual Rhythm (VR), a way to create time-spatial images. This integration enhances the system's efficiency by approximately 3 times when compared with conventional methods while maintaining similar accuracy.
