abstract = {Traffic congestion is caused by inefficient road operations and by excess demand. Inefficient traffic control is pervasive. Most urban streets and freeways do not have an adequate traffic sensing infrastructure, so one does not know how much congestion there is, its cause, or whether congestion mitigation projects have met the expected improvement. In the absence of adequate information, neither road operators nor travelers can gauge how poorly the road system is operated. Because the traffic changes randomly, the road system should be managed by effective feedback control of signals at intersections and at on-ramps. These control techniques are well known, and they have been successfully adopted in isolated road networks in different parts of the world. The investment in sensing needed to implement these control techniques is trivial compared to the benefits of an efficiently operated road system. But management is not able to quantify road system performance or how much improvement is possible and at what cost. Excess demand can be eliminated by appropriate incentives, including pricing. But empirical analysis of popular approaches such as HOV and HOT lanes suggests that they are ineffective unless the freeways are also efficiently managed. New ITS technologies, such as ‘integrated corridor management’ systems, while promising in theory, are likely to fail in the absence of a comprehensive traffic measurement system. More valuable might be initiatives that seek to shift modes away from private auto, adding bicycle and bus lanes, ridesharing, and telecommuting. Most of the data used in this analysis is from California.}

abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This research explores the increasing applications of deep learning in traffic management systems, with a focus on traffic prediction, object detection and recognition, autonomous vehicles, traffic flow optimization, and parking management. The results show that deep learning can improve transportation efficiency, reduce congestion, and enhance overall traffic management. One of the significant applications of deep learning in traffic management is traffic prediction. The findings suggest that deep learning models can accurately predict traffic patterns, enabling traffic managers to anticipate congestion and adjust traffic signal timings accordingly. However, one limitation of this application is the need for large amounts of historical data to train the models effectively, which may not be available in some regions or representative of current traffic conditions. The study finds that deep learning algorithms can detect and recognize objects in real-time, optimizing traffic signal timing, reducing collisions, and improving pedestrian safety. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the models can be affected by occlusions or cluttered scenes, particularly in challenging environments such as low-light or adverse weather conditions. Moreover, the research reveals that deep learning is a crucial technology in developing autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles can optimize traffic management by reducing congestion, optimizing routes, and improving overall transportation efficiency. Nonetheless, the models may struggle with handling edge cases, such as unexpected road conditions or obstacles, and require extensive testing to ensure safety and reliability. Additionally, the study suggests that deep learning models can analyze real-time traffic data to optimize traffic flow by adjusting signal timings, predicting traffic patterns, and rerouting traffic. However, one limitation of traffic flow optimization using deep learning is the need for real-time traffic data, which may not be available or accurate, affecting the effectiveness of the models. The findings show that deep learning can be used to identify available parking spaces in real-time, reducing the time and fuel spent by drivers searching for parking spaces. Nevertheless, deep learning models for parking management may struggle with accurately detecting and recognizing vehicles in crowded parking lots or complex parking structures. The cost of implementing the required hardware for real-time detection may also be prohibitive in some locations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}}

Advances in digital technology have enhanced the capabilities for detection of video events through the development of devices with high resolution, small physical size, and high sampling rates. This work presents and evaluates the use of feature descriptors extracted from visual rhythms of video sequences in three computer vision problems: abnormal event detection, human action classification, and gesture recognition. Experiments conducted on well-known public datasets demonstrate that the method produces promising results.},
